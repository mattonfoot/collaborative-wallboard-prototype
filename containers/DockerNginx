# Because this container is linked to the node one,
# it will not start the NGINX with this command:
#
# CMD     ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
#
# We have to use a startup script that configure NGINX
# with the node IP / port and then starts it.
# (Only because NGINX does not support system ENV variable in its config)
